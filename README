            $tractor->process(@filter);
            if ( $opts{list} ) {
                    $tractor->list;

    }
    $tractor->print_prereqs();

METHODS
  my $meta=$tractor->load_meta([$file]);
    Either hand over $file via parameter or set it during new. Parameter
    overwrites object.

    Return value is a CPAN::Meta object.

  $tractor->process (@filter);
    Expects meta in $self->meta. Sets $self->prereqs and also returns them
    as string hash.

    If @filter contains phases, they are left out.

    Warns when filters don't exist only in verbose mode.

  $tractor->print_prereqs;
    prints prereqs package names only to STDOUT

  $tractor->list;
    Prints prereqs from Meta file to STDOUT in a readable format

    TODO: Should I warn when phase is develop?
